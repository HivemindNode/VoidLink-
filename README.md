_A hidden RF mesh network._  

### What It Does:  
- **Creates an off-grid, peer-to-peer communication network using radio frequencies**  
- **Allows long-range messaging without internet or cellular networks**  
- **Uses frequency-hopping and encryption to prevent detection**  
- **Can operate in hostile environments where traditional networks are blocked**  

### Who Is It For?  
_"A connection that is unseen is a connection that cannot be controlled."_  

### How to Use:  
1. Deploy **VoidLink** on a T-Embed CC1101 module  
2. Start the RF mesh network:  
   ```bash
   python3 VoidLink.py --start
